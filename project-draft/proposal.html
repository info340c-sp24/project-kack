      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <h3>Overview of Food Banks and Food Insecurity</h3>
      <p>
        For our final project, we will be targeting the issue of food insecurity
        in the Seattle area, which leads to individuals not having reliable,
        quality, and nutritious food. Moreover, various people face food
        insecurity for different reasons such as economic hardship and social
        inequality. Seattle in particular has a pressing issue of insecurity due
        to high living costs and income inequalities. As a result, various food
        banks are located in the Seattle area to provide for community members
        who struggle to afford quality groceries. Due to the increased amount of
        people who require food bank services, food banks face challenges in
        meeting the high demand.
      </p>
      <h3>Identify an information technology problem in that space</h3>
      <p>
        A key information technology problem is the lack of centralized
        information regarding the needs of the food banks and the opportunities
        for donors to contribute to the needs of the food banks. Currently, food
        banks struggle to communicate their needs, and donors lack a streamlined
        process to identify where their contributions are most needed. This
        often leads to mismatches in donations and shortages of specific items.
      </p>
      <h3>At least 1 previous or existing attempt to solve this problem</h3>
      <p>
        There have been websites like
        <a
          href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/food-banks-are-struggling-to-keep-up-with-demand-as-the-holidays-approach/"
          >The Seattle Food Commitee </a
        >which includes a map for people to to find food banks near them and
        also gives contact information. However, food banks would not be able to
        request food items or be able to provide information that they need from
        users. These could be information such as dates to donate food, contact
        information, locations, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through creating this project, we hope to address the issue of food
        insecurity in the Seattle area and provide low-income individuals with
        greater access to nutritious food options. Furthermore, we want food
        banks to be able to request items they need at a certain time, so they
        can better serve the community with a diverse selection.

      <h2>App Description</h2>
      <h3>Who are the users of the application?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Food bank staff</li>
        <li>Food bank volunteers</li>
        <li>Food bank clients</li>
        <li>People who want to donate</li>
        <li>People that require food bank services</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our application will have the greatest impact on low-income minority
        individuals in the Seattle community. Our platform will allow these
        low-income individuals to have greater access to the meals they need the
        most.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What will the users do with the web app? What kind of interactive
        features are you expecting to provide? Remember that you app will need
        to include at least "two and a half" significant features; be sure to
        explicitly identify and explain what all of them are!
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Users that are looking to donate</b>: Be able to access an
          interactive map of the Seattle area that has pinpoints that show the
          various food banks in Seattle. The pinpoints will show which items are
          requested by the food banks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Food banks:</b> An online table that will be able to keep track of
          the type of items, dates, and locations, contact information that are
          donated. Be able to request for volunteers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Interaction between Food Banks and Donars:</b>An announcement
          feature that will allow food banks to communicate with clients and
          volunteers about what food they are currently lacking and any upcoming
          events that are being planned or happening.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The web app will provide food banks with a comprehensive platform for
        managing their operations and communicating with clients and volunteers.
        The app will include the following features:
      </p>
      <h3>What kind of information will the users be viewing?</h3>
      <p>
        Users will be able to view information from food banks, which will be
        able to post items that are lacking, allowing users to interact with
        these posts accordingly. These information will most likely be made up
        information by our group as we are not able to access real food bank
        data. Our main goal is display the functions and purpose of this app to
        the users.
      </p>
      <h3>How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem?</h3>
      <p>
        To solve the problems mentioned in the problem statement, our platform
        addresses the critical gap by creating a centralized hub that connects
        food banks with donors in the Seattle area. Since food banks can post
        their needs in real time, users can access that information, resulting
        in more effective donations. In doing so, we are optimizing the
        distribution of resources and empowering the Seattle community to better
        support those in need.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What is something that makes your life worse, and that you think that a
        web app might be able to help with?
      </h3>
      <p>
        One thing that makes our lives worse is not being able to have a good
        quality, nutritious meal. Our web app will address this problem by
        allowing food banks to have a more diverse selection of food options,
        enabling low-income individuals to achieve their proper daily nutritious
        needs.
