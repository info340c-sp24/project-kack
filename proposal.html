      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <h3>Overview of Food Banks and Food Insecurity</h3>
      <p>
        For our final project, we will be targeting the issue of food 
        insecurity in the Seattle area, which leads to individuals not 
        having reliable, quality, and nutritious food. Moreover, various people 
        face food insecurity for different reasons such as economic hardship 
        and social inequality. Seattle in particular has a pressing issue of 
        insecurity due to high living costs and income inequalities. As a result, 
        various food banks are located in the Seattle area to provide for 
        community members who struggle to afford quality groceries. 
        Due to the increased amount of people who require food bank services, 
        food banks face challenges in meeting the high demand.
      </p>
      <h3>Identify an information technology problem in that space</h3>
      <p>
        The current system for managing food bank operations and coordinating
        with volunteers and clients is inefficient and outdated. Food banks need
        a better way to manage their operations and communicate with clients and
        volunteers...
      </p>
      <h3>At least 1 previous or existing attempt to solve this problem</h3>
      <p>
        There are a few existing applications that help food banks manage their
        operations, but they are often expensive and difficult to use. Many food
        banks still rely on paper-based systems to manage their operations...

      <h2>App Description</h2>
      <h3>Who are the users of the application?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Food bank staff</li>
        <li>Food bank volunteers</li>
        <li>Food bank clients</li>
        <li>People who want to donate </li>
        <li>People that require food bank services</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our application will have the greatest impact on low-income minority 
        individuals in the Seattle community. Our platform will allow 
        these low-income individuals to have greater access to the meals they need the most.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What will the users do with the web app? What kind of interactive
        features are you expecting to provide? Remember that you app will need
        to include at least "two and a half" significant features; be sure to
        explicitly identify and explain what all of them are!
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Manage food bank operations</li>
        <li>Coordinate with volunteers</li>
        <li>Communicate with clients</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The web app will provide food banks with a comprehensive platform for
        managing their operations and communicating with clients and volunteers.
        The app will include the following features:
      </p>
      <h3>What kind of information will the users be viewing?</h3>
      <p>
        The app will provide users with access to a variety of information,
        including:
      </p>
      <h3>How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem?</h3>
      <p>
        The app will help food banks improve their operations by providing them
        with a more efficient and user-friendly way to manage their operations
        and communicate with clients and volunteers. By streamlining these
        processes, food banks will be able to serve more clients and provide
        better services to those in need.

            This article discusses the digital transformation of the Greater
            Boston Food Bank (GBFB) and highlights the challenges faced by food
            banks in communicating their needs and managing donations

            and enhance the experience for both food-insecure individuals and
            donorsâ€‹
